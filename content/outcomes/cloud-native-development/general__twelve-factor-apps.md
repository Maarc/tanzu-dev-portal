Cloud native app development has centered around the twelve factors described initially by the team behind the Heroku platform. The website [https://12factor.net](https://12factor.net/) provides a great bootstrapped understanding of how a cloud native application deals with aspects like logging, application state, and integration with external systems.

Sometimes itâ€™s enough to refactor and update an existing legacy application with only a handful of these factors to get it running on a cloud platform like VMware Tanzu Application Service (TAS), gaining the operational benefits of the platform without the large investment of a far-reach modernization effort.

Pay specific attention to these factors:
* [externalizing config](https://12factor.net/config)
* [converting integrations into backing services](https://12factor.net/backing-services)
* [keeping your processes stateless](https://12factor.net/processes)
* [logging to standard input and output](https://12factor.net/logs).

For more info on cloud native apps, check out the free book "[Beyond the Twelve-Factor App](https://content.pivotal.io/ebooks/beyond-the-12-factor-app)", where Kevin Hoffman introduces three additional factors including API-first development, security, and telemetry that were not covered in the original set but are often required for apps to run well in the cloud.
