As software engineers, we’ll be working with our tools of the trade the whole time. Here are some of the things you’ll want to brush up on before we arrive:

* Java 8 basics such as lambdas, the streams API, updated Date/Time libraries, default methods, and Optional.
* Your company’s modern build tool of choice (Maven or Gradle). We’ll lean on this for both dependency management as well as building our application deployable artifacts.
* Distributed source control with Git. You should be comfortable with the basic commands on the command line, including clone, fetch/merge/pull, add/rm, commit, and push.
* Your IDE of choice (Eclipse with the Spring Tools Suite or JetBrains IntelliJ). While we want our application and its build process to be decoupled from your development environment, this will be the tool you use day in and day out during the engagement so it pays to get familiar with common actions. You should be comfortable with the basics of creating and importing new projects, common code navigation, and some of the common refactoring commands. You’ll also want to know how to run tests within the IDE, as we’ll be doing that a lot.
