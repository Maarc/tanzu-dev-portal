As software engineers, we work with the tools of our trade the whole time. Still, it's always a good idea to take some time to brush up on a few things before starting your next engagement.

* **Java 8 basics** such as lambdas, the streams API, updated Date/Time libraries, default methods, and Optional.
* Your companyâ€™s modern **build tool** of choice (Maven or Gradle). We lean on this for both dependency management as well as building our deployable application artifacts.
* Distributed source control with **Git**. You should be comfortable with the basic commands on the command line, including clone, fetch/merge/pull, add/rm, commit, and push.
* Your **IDE** of choice. For example, Eclipse with the Spring Tools Suite or JetBrains IntelliJ. While we want our application and its build process to be decoupled from your development environment, you are going to use everyday during the engagement. It pays to get familiar with common actions. You should be comfortable with the basics of creating and importing new projects, common code navigation, and  common refactoring commands. You should also be familiar with how to run tests within the IDE, as we do that a lot.


#### Homework

- Review the applicable [tutorial(s)](https://howtodoinjava.com/) from Java 8 through your current version of Java.
- Run through the [Git tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials).
- If you are using Apache Maven for the build process, familiarize yourself with the [Baeldung tutorial](https://www.baeldung.com/maven) and [Maven in 5 Minutes guide](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html).
- If you are using Gradle for the build process, run through the [Gradle guides](https://gradle.org/guides).
- If you develop in the IntelliJ IDE, install the [learn plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8554-ide-features-trainer) and run through the interactive tutorials within the application.
