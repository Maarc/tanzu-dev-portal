We rely heavily on the [open-source ecosystem of Spring projects](https://spring.io/) to replace vendor- or container-specific technologies or proprietary solutions for Java-based applications. There are many specific tools and frameworks under that banner. During this engagement, we will show you which are the best tools to solve your specific problems. The two prerequisite tools are Spring Boot and Spring Cloud. Each one provides a common core that we use throughout the engagement.

## Spring Boot
Spring Boot provides a “convention over configuration” foundation for Spring-based applications. Follow [this guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/) to build a simple, RESTful web service using Spring Boot and minimal configuration.

## Spring Cloud

[Spring Cloud](http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/) provides a set of abstractions and integrations that enable best practice cloud native behavior. We will cover the actual implementation details for common tasks like externalizing configuration in a [Spring Cloud Config Server](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/reference/html/#_spring_cloud_config_server), using service discovery, API gateways, and other route services.

To have a better understanding of what tools you have in your tool belt before we get started, take some time to become familiar with the basic concepts of each tool, found in the introductions of the following documentation.

* [Part 1: Cloud Native Applications](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud.html#_cloud_native_applications)
* [Part 2: Spring Cloud Config](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud.html#_spring_cloud_config)
* [Part 3: Spring Cloud Netflix](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud.html#_spring_cloud_netflix) 
* [Part 4: Spring Cloud Stream](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud.html#_spring_cloud_stream)

#### Homework

- Use [this guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/) to build a simple RESTful web service using Spring Boot and minimal configuration.
