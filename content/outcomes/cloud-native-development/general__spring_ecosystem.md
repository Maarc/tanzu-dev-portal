We will lean heavily on the [open-source ecosystem of Spring projects](https://spring.io/) to replace vendor- or container-specific technologies or proprietary solutions for Java-based applications. There are many specific tools and frameworks under that banner, though, and we will get into the best ones to solve your specific problems during the engagement. The two that you should get to know beforehand are Spring Boot and Spring Cloud, as they provide a common core that we will use from the very first days of the engagement.

## Spring Boot
Spring Boot provides a “convention over configuration” foundation for Spring-based applications. Follow [this guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/) to build a simple RESTful web service using Spring Boot and minimal configuration.

## Spring Cloud

[Spring Cloud](http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/) provides a set of abstractions and integrations that enable best practice cloud-native behavior. We will cover the actual implementation details for common tasks like externalizing configuration in config-server, using service discovery, and API gateways other route services.
Here, you should get familiar with the basic concepts from their documentation to understand better what tools you have in your toolbelt once we get started.
