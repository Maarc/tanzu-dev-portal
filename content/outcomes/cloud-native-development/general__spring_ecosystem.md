## Spring Framework

For Java-based applications, we’ll lean heavily on the [open-source ecosystem of Spring projects](https://spring.io/) to replace vendor- or container-specific technologies or proprietary solutions. There are a ton of specific tools and frameworks under that banner though, and we’ll get into the best ones to solve your specific problems during the engagement. The two that you should get to know beforehand are Spring Boot and Spring Cloud, as they provide a common core that we’ll use from the very first days of the engagement.

## Spring Boot
Spring Boot provides a “convention over configuration” foundation for Spring-based applications. Follow [this guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/) to build a simple RESTful web service using Spring Boot and minimal configuration.

## Spring Cloud

[Spring Cloud](http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/) provides a set of abstractions and integrations that enable best practice cloud-native behavior. We’ll cover the actual implementation details for common tasks like externalizing configuration in config-server, using service discovery, and API gateways other route services, but get familiar with the basic concepts from their documentation to better understand what tools you have in your toolbelt once we get started.
