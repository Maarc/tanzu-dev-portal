One of the additional three factors introduced in Beyond the Twelve Factors includes telemetry. Developing your application is only the first part of a cloud-native developers job - real users hitting your app is where the real validated learning and feedback come into play to make your app better.

Spring Boot provides a bunch of automatic health monitoring and metrics through the Actuator and Micrometer projects. With these included in your Spring Boot app you get automatic self-monitoring and reporting by the application itself, and there are a number of extension points for adding custom health indicators and other metrics. Run through the Actuator guide to build a RESTful web service with this functionality, or add it to one of the applications youâ€™ve already built as part of this guide.
