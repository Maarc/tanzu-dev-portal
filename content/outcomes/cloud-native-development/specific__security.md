Security in a distributed system can be a daunting task, since you can’t fall back to some big centralized security module on a monolithic web server. Spring Boot provides the Spring Security package to provide a general abstraction layer for configuring your application security without relying on the specific container or deployment environment.
We’ll look to wire up security for migrated services using this module, and they’ve provided [a great guide to securing web services](https://spring.io/guides/gs/securing-web/) to walk you through the basic configuration via Java beans and the domain-specific language. You’ll want to run through this exercise so that you’re comfortable introducing the technology to your applications during the engagement. We’ll cover the specifics of more advanced configuration during the engagement, but it’ll help to recognize the basics from the get-go.
