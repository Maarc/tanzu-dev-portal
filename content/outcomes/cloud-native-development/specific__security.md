Security in a distributed system can be a daunting task since you cannot rely on some large centralized security module on a monolithic web server. Spring Boot provides the Spring Security package to offer a general abstraction layer for configuring your application security without relying on the specific container or deployment environment.

We will look to wire up security for newly created or modernized services using this module. The Spring team provided a great [guide to securing web applications](https://spring.io/guides/gs/securing-web/) to walk you through the basic configuration via Java beans and the domain-specific language. You will want to run through this exercise to be comfortable introducing the technology to your applications. We will cover the specifics of more advanced configuration during the engagement, but it will help recognize the get-go basics.

#### Homework

- Run through the [Securing Web Services](https://spring.io/guides/gs/securing-web/) guide.
