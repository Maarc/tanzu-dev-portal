## Why is this learning path important?

This learning path provides the foundational knowledge around modern, cloud-native software development with Spring and Cloud-Foundry. It has been conceived as pre-work to get the most of an application-related software development engagement with Tanzu Labs. 

## Who is this learning path for?
 
This learning path is for software engineers and other members of the technical development team involved in a Tanzu Labs engagement.

## What you will learn
 
Each section of this guide provides details about the skills or technologies in question, and includes links to specific and targeted information to assist you. Each section is followed by suggested homework assignments and additional resources.

It should take about eight hours to complete the material in this learning path. However, the more time you put into the learnng path, the more you will get out of the engagement.
