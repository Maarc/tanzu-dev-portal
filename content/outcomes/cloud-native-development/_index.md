## Why is this important?

This learning path will provide you with foundational knowledge around modern, cloud native software development with Spring and Tanzu Application Service (TAS).

It has been initially conceived as pre-work to get the most of an application-related software development engagement with Tanzu Labs. However, we also find this learning path highly effective without service engagement.

## Who is this learning path for?
 
This learning path is for software engineers and architects interested in quickly ramping up their cloud native skills with Spring Boot.

## What you will learn
 
Each section of this guide provides some context to the skills or technologies in question, with links throughout to specific and targeted info you will need. Each section is followed by a list of suggested homework and optional additional resources.

Going through the material of this learning path should not take more than 8 hours. The more time you spend, for example by studying deeper the provided additional resources, the more you will get out of this learning path.
